CRDTextView for iOS
==================

The `CRDTextView` class inherits from `UILabel` and implements a read-only
text view adding the following capabilities of a `UITextField` object:
- `placeholder` and `secureText` text attributes;
- ability to copy the `text` property value to the pasteboard.

The `CRDTextView` class is deployed together a demo iPhone app to show
various use case scenarios. It has been developed as an Xcode 4.6.2 project
targeting iOS 6.1.

Some screenshots of the demo app can be found [here]
